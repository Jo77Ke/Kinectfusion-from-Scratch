# KinectFusion from Scratch

## Project description
To deepen our understanding in 3D Surface reconstruction, we worked on re-implementing the KinectFusion pipeline, presented by [Newcombe et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6162880), from scratch.

## Dataset
To test our implmentation, we used pre-recorded RGB-D data provided in Sturm et al.'s [A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6385773).

## Approach

### Input
- [x] Read depth and rgb images from sensor into depth and color maps
- [x] Read camera intrinsics and extrinsics

### Output
- [x] Project depth map into 3D vertex map using camera intrinsics
- [x] Triangulate vertices into a mesh and write it to a file

### Pre-processing (per frame)
- [x] Apply a bilateral filter on the depth map to reduce noise
- [x] Compute a normal map from the depth map
- [x] Implement sub-sampling (block averaging with depth values within $3\sigma_r$ of the central pixel)

### Volumetric Fusion
- [x] Compute projective TSDF
- [x] Implement running average for incrementally adding a new frame

### Surface Prediction
- [x] Implement ray-casting

### Pose Estimation
- [x] Implement ICP

## Installation & Configuration

### Installing dependencies
```bash
    sudo apt update -qq -y && sudo apt upgrade -qq -y && sudo apt install -qq -y build-essentials libeigen3-dev libopencv-dev
```

### Setting environment variables to configure OpenMP parallelization
```bash
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<N_THREADS>;OMP_PROC_BIND=true;OMP_PLACES=cores
```
Replace `<N_THREADS>` with the number of threads you want to use.
